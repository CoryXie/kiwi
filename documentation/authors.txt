Kiwi is primarily written by the following people:

 * Alex Smith <alex@alex-smith.me.uk>
 * Philip Kent <kentphilip@googlemail.com>

A full list of contributors can be obtained by looking through the
Mercurial repository history.

Different parts of Kiwi's design have been inspired by other OSes,
and these deserve credit:

 * HelenOS (http://www.helenos.org)
   - Parts of multi-CPU/synchronization code.
 * Haiku (http://www.haiku-os.org)
   - Some memory management code.
 * Meander (written by froggey on IRC)
   - Helped me get started with writing my first os, Exclaim.
