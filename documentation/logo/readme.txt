The logo for small exports.svg file is the SVG file used to make the logos used
on the Wiki, Loggerhead and the smaller logo on News. This is because under smaller
exports, some of the details of the logo are lost due to the size they shrink by.
Therefore this SVG has larger details on the seeds and gradient so that when they
export they are still visible. Please use the first SVG for larger logo exports.

The font the logo uses is called Purisa, which should be available in your distributions
Thai font packages. Please consult your distributions package manager for details on
retrieving this font. The font is a free and open source GNU GPL font, however, an
extra clause is used so works using the font are not required to be licensed under the
GNU GPL.
