System call services
====================

The kernel system call interfaces allows multiple system call "services".
This allows modules to provide their own system call interfaces alongside
the main kernel system call interface. The following service numbers are
currently defined:

    0     - Kernel

If you're writing a module that needs its own system call interface, you
should ask Alex to assign a service number that you can use.
